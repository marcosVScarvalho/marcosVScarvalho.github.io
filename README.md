# coaglio site

Personal website built with pure HTML and CSS, featuring custom animations, a dark aesthetic, and a fully responsive layout.

This project does not rely on any external frameworks or theme engines. All layout, styling, and motion effects were handcrafted to maintain full control over the visual identity and performance.

The main structure of the project is as follows:

```
❯ tree

├── CNAME
├── cpts.png
├── index.html
├── README.md
├── skull.gif
└── styles.css
```
